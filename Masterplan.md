# Rules

The no. of people in the club is increasing and mentoring is not going as smoothly as we expected or, it can be improved from the current scenario. So we have:

1. All senior mentors must build a good relationship with all first years. Also make sure that the third years do the same. 
2. Each student will have a doc which contains info about their tasks which will be kept on track by their respected mentors. Mentors can keep a check on mentees by keeping track in the trello cards, mentees can update it(Creating a readme.md for each tasks and asking them to create a PR to add their project link.)
3. ### Mentor-mentee relation :
  * Their family background
  * What is their vision for the club and how do they plan to implement it.
  * what aspirations they have in life
  * which place they are from
  * which school they studied
  * what they want to get out of foss club
  * their favorite food etc 
4. ### Activities:
* Hackathon
* Project
* Surprise viva(Just regarding what all they have done to know their commitment)
* Talks
5. ### Tasks:
* ### Google effectively - 1 week 
  * A talk on how to google effectively followed by practice of googling for about a week and finding things on their own.
* ### Familiarization of CLI-
  * Learn frequently -used 50 shell commands.
  * [Link1](https://lifehacker.com/5633909/who-needs-a-mouse-learn-to-use-the-command-line-for-almost-anything)
  * [Link2](http://ubuntu-maryland.org/presentations/cli_presentation.pdf)
  * [Bandit](http://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/)
* Session on how to blog, followed by asking them to blog on what all they learnt. Make sure that the students get a hit of 5k views after their 1st year.
  * First blog will be about an experience/event/ basically non-technical.
  * Should be at least one per month.
  * Familiarization of git(session)
  * [resources to learn git](http://try.github.io/)
  * [udacity course](https://in.udacity.com/course/github-collaboration--ud456)
  * [github/hello-world/](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/)
  * [Git guide](http://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/)
* Project: Innovative application (desktop applications, web application, Android) / test cases , bugs 
* Session which will be taken by 3rd/4th year on Introduction to open source followed by students starting to contribute to open source.
  The session will include:
    * What is open source
    * How you can begin your contribution
    * Asking your questions/doubts in IRC
    * Telling the students their experiences
* Participate in hackathon hosted by club:
  * FOSS club will host a hackathon where the first years will be contributing to a project(Done by seniors).
* Exercism-  in whatever language they want(c/cpp)
  * C language can be preferred as it is easier to grasp concepts in any other language after learning it.
* Install [Apache](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-linux-apache-mysql-php-lamp-stack-on-ubuntu-16-04) and print hello world
* Docker:
  * Understanding what and why Docker is used. [Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFl2mCHdv24) to the tutorial.
* [CS50](http://cs50.tv/2016/fall/). Followed by asking about their logic(reviewers can do that, as mentors might be busy)
* Automation: There are multiple tasks that we do manually. Students need to figure out a way to automate these tasks:
--> They can start by following the book- Automate the boring stuff with Python whose videos are available on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1F_OgqRuSdI&list=PLGoJzB271_7r-iLYuEHEPJ5pSIYxXjJEn). 
--> Another idea is to detect nutritional facts in a product and extract the data from it and populate the database with it. Idea is to make the process automated and the contributor just has to click the picture of the product and the rest will be taken care by back-end.
* Learn basics of [networking](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/basics-computer-networking/) and [OS](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/operating-systems/). 
* Google scraping task: The student is supposed to write a python script which takes a query as input and searches for it in google and gets the links to the first 10 websites and display them.
Download all the images from a website like [this](http://www.omgbeaupeep.com/), using python : this way they would have to use loops, know how to download images. Later on the can build a website such that they can view the images they have downloaded. They would also be motivated to continue as they have actually built something which can be used. 
Scrape details about products from Flipkart or Amazon using python or preferably node.js, this way they could learn some concepts about shopping carts too.
* make a web portfolio with  jekyll blog.
* Password hack: Learn to change password in Ubuntu.
* Find Default port number - Testing Linux command 
  * System calls that would enable us to find the default port number that our local resolver uses.
  * [Link 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h3fJlmuGyos).
* Session on Linux Debugging
* Sessions on GDB, valgrind etc (debugging) so that the first years would have good hold on the topics such as pointers, memory management etc.
* Gdb Debugging contest. 
  * We will provide buggy code and they will use gdb and all to find the issue and solve them.
* Sessions on Basic programming.
* Learn - STL class
  * [Link 1](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/the-c-standard-template-library-stl/).
* Introduction to web development (HTML, css,js) (session followed by tasks). The tasks will be given by 3rd/4th year students and will be reviewed by a 2nd year student.
* Projects assigned by the mentors to mentees by the end of 3 months. 2-3 students from a different background can join together and do the project. They will discuss their interests with their mentors and then come up with a project idea with mentor’s help.
* Creating a website(Shopping cart, Flight booking, Hotel booking etc)
  * Create login page and signup page (using node js/angularjs)
* Getting familiar with IRC channel.
* Our IRC channel [amfoss](https://www.irccloud.com/irc/freenode/channel/amfoss).
